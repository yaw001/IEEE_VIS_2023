            1. You will see a display of objects.<br>
            2. Your task is to estimate the average position of these objects.<br><br>
            <b>RISKS</b>. No potential risks or discomforts are anticipated except for the possibility that some tasks
            may be slightly boring.<br><br>
            PAYMENT/REMUNERATION<b></b>. In consideration of your time and inconvenience, you will receive half hour of
            course credit. The procedures and length of participation will last approximately 15-20 minutes.<br><br>

            rights as a research subject or to report research-related problems.<br><br>
            <b>BENEFITS</b>. There will be no direct benefit to you from these procedures. However, the investigator may
            learn more about basic questions pertaining to attention, memory, perception, cognition.<br><br>
            <b>EXPLANATION.</b> The researcher has explained this study to you and answered your questions. If you have
            questions or research related problems, you may reach Edward Vul at 858-534-4401.<br><br>
            <b>VOLUNTARY NATURE OF PARTICIPATION.</b> Participation in research is entirely voluntary. You may refuse to

            research, there is also the possibility of loss of confidentiality. Information from participants will be
            identified by a study number. The database which relates the study number to a specific subject will be
            maintained in the study coordinators office.<br><br>
            <b>COPY OF CONSENT.</b> You have received a copy of this consent document to keep and a copy of the
